# Computer Science

## What?

It's basically bunch of cool stuff people study to make computers look smart.

## why?

Everyone had their own why. But I will tell you about mine

- computer science is super cool!!!
- It's so fun and they even pay you for having funðŸ¤© 

## How and where?

1. First thing is to meet them, have a look
2. Learn their language(which is hard), so we have translators(**Programming languages**)
3. There are lots of things computers can do(Building websites, understand human language,...). So choose one of them and explore
4. Stand on the shoulder of Giants. You don't have to start from zero. There is a ton of stuff people have built called software. You can use those and build even more amazing stuff. [Github](https://github.com) is one such places where people share their software.
